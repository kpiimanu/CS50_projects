# The following collection of 70+ programs were written by myself (Keala Piimanu) over the course of taking courses through Harvard University/Ed-Ex

#### All programs were written as I was self learning programming and understanding different components to logic and computer science.

#### The majority of the programs are written in Python. Though there are some written in C as well as some additional files.


#### There wasnt a better way to keep files that went together for certain programs on this repository. 

#### But for my use cases, this was my best attempt in organizing the collection of programs I have written.
